I have background in signal processing during Undergrad and introductory 
courses in AI related topics at the time. 
Then I did Master's in Computer Engineering specializing in Computer
Architecture with work on GPU architecture research. Currently I am working in
Graphics drivers team. Revisiting my earlier interests
with experience in accelerating algorithms on GPU, this profile is to convey
the unique perspective I bring to machine learning.
