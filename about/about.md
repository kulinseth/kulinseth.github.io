<p class="lead">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Kulin Seth</span></p>
<p>I work at <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/">Qualcomm Inc.</a> 
as Sr. Software Engineer for Graphics driver development 
(<a href="https://www.khronos.org/opengles/">OpenGL ES</a>
/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulkan_(API)">Vulkan</a>) 
targeting Android platforms.</p>

My interests are in machine learning, GPU programming, 
architectural simulations and signal processing 
with focus on embedded systems.

I have background in signal processing during Undergrad and introductory 
courses in AI related topics at the time. 
Then I did Master's in Computer Engineering specializing in Computer
Architecture with work on GPU architecture research. Currently I am working in
Graphics drivers team. Revisiting my earlier interests
with experience in accelerating algorithms on GPU, this profile is to convey
the unique perspective I bring to machine learning.
